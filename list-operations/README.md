# ðŸ“‹ List Operations in C#

This console application demonstrates various operations on `List<string>` in C#, including:

- Adding and inserting elements
- Finding elements and their indices
- Filtering elements using conditions
- Removing elements by value, index, or condition

The code is part of my C# learning journey and focuses on understanding how memory and list manipulation works.
