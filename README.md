# üß† C# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of small projects and exercises developed during my studies of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with C#.  
The main goal is to reinforce core OOP principles through hands-on practice.

---

## Note

This repository tracks my progress through a C# course. The exercises are organized by module and follow the concepts as they are introduced.

‚û°Ô∏è Features like **exception handling**, **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and others will only be implemented in the modules where these topics are covered.

‚ö†Ô∏è Therefore, some earlier exercises may not include best practices that I already know, but I chose to stick to the course's didactic sequence. The goal is to build up knowledge step by step until the final project.
