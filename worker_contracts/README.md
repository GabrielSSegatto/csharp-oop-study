# 📝 Worker Contracts Manager

Small C# console application developed as part of my studies in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created during the module focused on **Classes**, **Enums**, **Lists**, and **Basic User Input**.

Its main goal is to practice:

- Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Working with classes and relationships
- Using enums to represent data categories
- Handling lists of objects
- Calculating data based on user input and conditions

---

## 📚 Features

- Register a **Worker**
- Assign the worker to a **Department**
- Add multiple **Hour-based Contracts** to the worker
- Calculate **monthly income** for the worker, based on contracts and base salary

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET SDK (Console Application)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

## 📌 Topics Practiced

- Classes
- Constructors
- Lists
- Enums
- User Input (Console)

---
## ⚠️ Note

This project was developed before learning about exception handling and advanced input validation.
The focus here was purely on object-oriented structure and data manipulation logic.

Future projects will include more robust error handling and best practices as I progress in the course.
